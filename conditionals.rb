# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.

# x = 10

# if x == 10
#   p 0
# else
#   p -1
# end

# 8. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 100 if the number equals 100, prints 99 if the number is equal to 99, and prints 0 otherwise.

# x = 90

# if x == 100
#   p 100
# elsif x == 99
#   p 99
# else
#   p 0
# end

# x = 10

# if x == 10
#   p 0

# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

# if x == 10
#   p 0

# 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.

x = 6
y = 99
